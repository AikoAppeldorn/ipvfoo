Privacy Policy

IPvFoo has full access to your web traffic, as this is necessary to present
the table of connection information.  All information is kept in RAM on your
computer, and never transmitted over the network.

Technically there is one exception: if you use the "Look up on bgp.he.net"
feature, your browser will navigate to a URL managed by Hurricane Electric,
containing the selected domain name or IP address.


My other Chrome extensions do not use personal information at all:
- Incognito Proxy
- Endless Whisper
- <pre> Line Wrapper
